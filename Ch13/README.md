# Media Control Interface and PlaySound

The files in this folder pertain to interacting with audio files via [Media Control Interface (MCI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Control_Interface) and [PlaySound](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/multimedia/the-playsound-function) interfaces. In particular, both [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) files and [WAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV) file formats are utilized to demonstrate the capavbilities. However, PlaySound also supports interacting with MP3 and other file formats.
